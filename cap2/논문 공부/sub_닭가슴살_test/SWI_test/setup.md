### Test setup (quasi-static strain)

1. Load cell : 5N
2. Test speed : strain rate of 0.05%.s
3. Test details : 
> -To reduce friction between platens and samples, silicon oil was sprayed on both platens 
> -To evaulate the fluid exudation during compression,  the samples were patted dry with a tissue (to decrease the effect of PBS spraying) and then weighed before and after each experiment.
> -The peak load (0.2 N) obtained from preliminary tests was considered as the maximum force and a preload of 0.01 N was chosen (1/20 maximum load) to make sure the platen touches the top surface of the tissue.
4. Test limitation  : 30% 

### Statistical analysis


1. The normality of the data was checked using Excel z-value Normal Distribution Calculation
2.  Two-way ANOVA with deformation direction and stretch ratio
